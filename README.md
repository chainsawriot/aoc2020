# AOC 2020 (Rcpp)

I mean, why not?

1. I will use the least amount of R possible. Probably, I will only use R for purifying data.
2. Use C++ but in the least effort possible, i.e. probably I will only use things in `std`.

R code is embedded also in the C++ code. Running the Rcpp code with

```r
Rcpp::sourceCpp("d1.cpp")
```
